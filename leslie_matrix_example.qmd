## Leslie matrix example

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture.

Render is the same as knit

create a vector, then wrap it into a 3x3 matrix

making it in one step, you can make it in two steps

```{r}

insect_leslie <-matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0),
                       nrow = 3, 
                       ncol = 3, 
                       byrow = TRUE)

insect_leslie
```

time to do some calculation, we need to give it an initial condition

```{r}
#Initial Condition, create the vector of IC values
insect_y0 <-c(12000, 700, 500)

```

```{r}
insect_y1 <-insect_leslie %*% insect_y0

insect_y1
```

Estimate Populations at each life stage at year 2 and year 3

```{r}
insect_y2 <-insect_leslie %*% insect_y1

insect_y2
```

```{r}
insect_y3 <-insect_leslie %*% insect_y2

insect_y3
```
